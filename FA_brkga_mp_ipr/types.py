    This class represents a chromosome using a vector in the unitary
    hypercube, i.e., :math:`v \\in [0,1]^n` where :math:`n` is the size of the
    array (dimensions of the hypercube).

    Note that this base class is a simple list of float numbers and can be
    used in the algorithm directly. However, in some cases, the user wants
    additional capabilities in the Chromosome class, such as extra data and
    so. For instance, in the example below, the chromosome also keeps the
    makespan and total completion time for a scheduling problem:

    .. code-block:: python

        class SchedulingChromosome(BaseChromosome):
            def __init__(self, value):
                super().__init__(value)
                self.makespan = 0.0
                self.total_completion_time = 0.0

    Note that when subclassing BaseChromosome, we must define the method
    ``__init__(self, value)`` and call the parent (``BaseChromosome``)
    constructor. We need at least one argument to be passed to
    ``BaseChromosome`` constructor.
