This package provides a very easy-to-use framework for the Multi-Parent
Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with Implict Path Relink (BRKGA-MP-IPR).
Assuming that your have a decoder to your problem, we can setup, run, and
extract the value of the best solution in less than 5 commands (obvisiously,
you may need few other lines fo code to do a proper test).
